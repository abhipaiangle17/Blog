IIT Bombay, one of the most prestigious institutes in India and the world offers a little more, actually a lot more than just education. Having spent a year at this premiere institute where you will find crème de la crème, I have some things to express.

29 June 2019: It was 6 in the morning when I landed in Mumbai with my parents. As we were heading towards my dream college, several thoughts popped up in my mind. How I learnt about IITs ? How has the struggle been for the last 2 years ? What type of people will I meet there ? Is IIT a right decision? And many more to which I didn't have answers to. I was told by many that if you get into IIT your life is settled. Now it seems funny. It's human nature to make your mind drift towards the thought that satisfies you. Lost in these thoughts and Mumbai traffic, we finally reached the main gate of IIT Bombay.

 When we first entered the campus, I was shocked to believe the fact that this holy place existed in Mumbai. It was calm and serene with the invigorating fragrance of the rainy soil. As we reached near the main building, I could see the real picture of it which I had been seeing on the internet. That was the time when I saw some of the smartest minds in the country. Some looked tense, some were happy. After successfully confirming the admission, we returned to Goa.

 The next one month passed in the blink of an eye. There was excitement within me for a whole new journey as well as the fear of staying away from home but the excitement of finding a new home outweighed the fear. My mom practically packed every handy stuff as if I was going to Antarctica. 
<br><br>
We were back at IIT, but this time with luggage and hopes. The hostel road was full of shops selling cycles, sim cards, mattresses, and daily use items. First time when I saw the hostel, I was awstruck. It was much better than what I’d expected. All that I had heard before was that the rooms are very small and dingy, there are cows in the hostels and stuff. But IITB does keep its freshmen in a nice hostel. The mess food which I thought would be pathetic turned out to be tasty. Okay, not very tasty but just above my expectations. I was allotted a room on the 8th floor. The view was beautiful. Hiranandani as viewed from our wing was very charming.

 The next 2-3 days were very hectic. There were orientations after orientations. Plus, I wanted to explore the campus. The campus was huge. This 550 acres of land had almost everything you ask for. For sports there were courts for Table Tennis, Badminton, Basketball, Indoor Cricket, Tennis, Squash and what not. All of them maintained to great standards. There was a gym with so much equipment but it was sometimes crowded. There were 3 grounds, one each for Cricket, Hockey and Football. I was also told that when the Prime Minister arrived for Convocation the previous year, students had made a helipad on these grounds where the PM had landed.

<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Soon I learned that this was not it. There were different clubs for different activities like Coding, Robotics,  Aeromodelling, Music, Dance, Literature, Photography and whatever comes to mind. Each club had their own orientations and events. This was the time I remembered one of the professors saying in an orientation “There are so many ongoing activities in IIT, that you will feel education is an extracurricular activity here”. The lectures started soon and even the lecture halls did not wait to surprise me.The Architecture was great. Initially it was hard to grasp concepts but soon I got used to the fact that it is going to be challenging and I have to put some extra effort into understanding things. It was all of a sudden new learning experience, shifting from paper and pen to pdfs and slides.

I was an ambivert back then. I mostly used to hang out with my Goan friends. It took me a week or a while to make friends with wingies( wingmates ). We started to know each other and our backgrounds since every other guy was from a different location right up from Delhi and UP, way down to Kerala. Then things started going pretty smooth in our wing. There were talks, movies, games being played upto 2-3 A.M in the night. There were night canteens in every hostel which operated till 3 A.M which killed our late night hunger.

We had started this game of wing cricket where we used “jhadu” for a bat. Once the director of the institute entered our wing and we did not recognise him as the director. Having mistaken him for a random guy visiting the hostel, we asked him to handover the ball which went towards him and started telling him rules of our own invented game. Surprisingly, he was happy to see us playing and got himself interested in our game. Little did we know that we were explaining our game to the director of the institute.
<br><br>
The moment I started thinking I was settled, a new thing used to pop up. We had already spent 2-3 weeks in the Insti( lingo for Institute ) by then and there was a lot more to explore. We had to explore different places in the Institute, and obviously Mumbai. We had to adapt to Insti culture. We had to get used to words like “Insti”, ”RG-giri”( RG means relative grading and RG-giri is betraying others for getting a better grade), ”Enthu”(enthusiasm), ”Junta”( Public ),“Pandhra- Sola”( H-15,16), “MoodI TF”( Mood Indigo and Techfest ),  “GPL”( Google it please ! ), and many more. Eating the same mess food and listening to your friend’s rejection story was a common practice now. Things went by so fast that there was no time to introspect. I realised that I was just at the tip of the iceberg. This exploration would never end.
