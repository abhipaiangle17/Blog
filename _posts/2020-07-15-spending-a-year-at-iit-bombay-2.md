Weeks went by and I started hearing the word ‘acads’ more often. It was the “Mid Sem” time. It was the first exam which carried a good amount of weightage in the academic performance and I was not a “maggu” after all. After looking at the tutorials, the first instinct I got was that I should at least manage to pass. But as time passed and I managed balance between acads and timepass, I started getting better expectations from myself. And now here I was, at the brink of answering the mid sem. 
<br><br>
The lecture halls and canteens remained open throughout the night during the mid sem. Me along with some of my wingies spent those horrible yet amazing nights in lecture halls. The only part I loved about those nights was the short visit to the nearest H-10 Canteen that served amazingly delicious “Maggi”. The mid sem stress added more taste to it. There are twelve different types of “Maggi” served in IITB hostel canteens, my personal favourite being “Toppa Maggi” which is “Maggi + Sunny-side up egg”. We ended up inventing new Maggi recipes, one of them was adding potato wafers and “Kurkure” to it.
<br><br>
The mid sem was finally over. Without thinking much of the coming results, on a drizzling night, we planned to go for a movie. “Chhichhore” had just released and we wanted to watch it. It was shot at IIT Bombay, and secondly the director was IIT Bombay alumni, and finally it would be our mid sem stress buster.
 <br><br>
We booked a late night show. It was around 11. The theatre was just a mile away from the campus in Kanjurmarg. There were five of us and in no way we were fitting in a single Rickshaw. I can bet that every IIT Bombay guy must have received more rejections from ‘rickshawalas’ to go to Kanjurmarg than from their so-called crushes (Okay, don't use your math here). After tons of rejections, we managed to find 2 rickshaws to go to Kanjurmarg.

The theatre empty but the movie was great. It was 2 in the morning. The good thing about IITB is that it doesn’t have any time restrictions to enter inside hostels. Taking advantage of this fact, we decided to explore something more. When there are no plans in mind, and you want to go somewhere to relax in Mumbai, which better place can you think of other than Marine Drive ! We called up one more friend, ordered a cab and were set to spend the night at the great Marine Drive.

We reached the place at 3 and we were shocked ! The place was largely empty. There was no sign of a single buzzing mosquito. This was absolutely not the thing that we expected. Marine Drive is known to have plenty of crowds at night. When I had visited the place for the previous time, it was largely crowded with the ‘Chowpatty’ stalls open to serve ‘Pav Bhaji’, ‘Ice-creams’, ‘Dosas’, ‘Pizzas’, ‘Milkshakes’ and what not. But this time it was different. It was not a weekend. Soon we also realised that the place was placed under ‘Red Alert’. Knowing this fact, we planned to rush away from the place but sometimes nature just doesn’t allow you to go by your will. It started to rain. The rain wasn’t light. In Mumbai, it just takes a few ticks on the clock to rainstorm from absolutely nowhere. Instead of rushing away from the place, we rushed to the nearest shelter. 
<br><br>
Rain lasted for about twenty minutes. It was already 4 in the morning.  we decided to stay and do some “Bakchodi” ( insti lingo for timepass ). With absolutely no idea on what to do, we started clicking pictures, not normal portraits or landscapes, but weird pictures .

It was five in the morning and probably the time to go. We headed towards the ‘Churchgate’ station to catch the local train. It was really surprising to see how the ‘Mumbaikars’ rushed to the local trains even at such an odd time.  As we reached the campus, it was already six. The night had finally turned into the day and friends into a family...
