Hey there, 
<br><br>
Glad that you landed here. My thoughts might entertain you or maybe get some giggle out of you but will definitely not bore you! But first let me introduce myself. 
<br><br>
Abhishek here, Undergaduate Sophomore at IIT Bombay. Turning caffeine into code since past 2 years. My areas of interest are Deep Learning, Image Processing, Automation and Web Development but not limiting my domain to these. A lot of things have to be explored that I know that I don't know and that I don't know that I don't know.  
<br><br>
Some of my activities at the institute include being Convener for Web and Coding Club which is the official programming club of the Institute. I am also part of the tech team Innovation Cell - IIT Bombay, working as Jr. Computer Vision Engineer for the project SeDriCa, India's first self driving car. You may check out my resume to know more about my work.

This is my personal landing page where I blog on anything that I find interesting in my life. It was the night of 3rd June 2020, when the World was taking a break due to the pandemic, the idea of writting blog hit up my mind. Also wanted to improve my Web Dev skills. Looking forward to entertain you!! Go have a read !
<br><br>
Ciao!
