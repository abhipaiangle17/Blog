> It's not about ideas, it's about making the ideas happen!!

Hey Reader, 

Abhishek here , a Curious Coder.

I am 1st year Undergaduate student at IIT Bombay, specialising in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science. My interests are Coding, Machine Learning, Exploring new places and Going on adventures. I like Table-tennis, Cricket, Basketball and Football. In my free time I prefer binge-watching over sleeping. 

This is my blog where I write about my Research, Projects, Current Affairs, and basically what I find interesting in my life. It was the night of 3rd June 2020, when the World was taking a break due to the pandemic, the idea of writting blog hit up my mind. Looking forward to entertain you!! Go have a read !

Ciao!
