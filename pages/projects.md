* Description

This is one of my Team project for Innovation Cell, IIT Bombay. It is focused towards developing two bots. First bot is capable of detecting obstacles and finding a path without getting hit autonomously. It is also capable of detecting a specific text if it exists in its view. Task of second bot is to follow the first bot autonomously. Used sensors are Camera and Hokuyu Laser Sensor. Developed in ROS, used rospy library for scripts and Gazebo for environment and simulation. 

### Chat Application 

![app-pichat](/assets/img/projects/app-pichat.png)

* Description

This is a Chat Application I have developed using Flask and WebSockets( SocketIO ). This chat application allows users to login with Display Name and Password. Conversations are carried out in Channels which users can create. Every channel has a channel key except General channel which is default channel for all users. This channel key is defined by the user who creates the channel. Presently it is deployed on heroku with gunicorn server. It does not store data in a database as of its current version but will be implemented soon. Also the UI is not mobile responsive yet. So if you are using it on mobile, please see the  'desktop-site' version.
